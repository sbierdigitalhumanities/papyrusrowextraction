This repository aims at extracting rows from facsimile of papyri.

Please clone this repository with `git clone https://github.com/sbierdigitalhumanities/papyrusrowextraction.git`. 

Each notebook contains in the beginning imports of the necessary packages. Please make sure you have these packages installed. When installing scikit-learn I would recommend the version 1.2.1, as this is the version that I use.

The IPython notebooks in this repository all start with a number, indicating the order in which they are supposed to be executed.
